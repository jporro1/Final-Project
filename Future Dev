I had originally planned to make this a 2d RPG with a hub area, leveling system,
weapon upgrades, and a couple different areas in which one could find enemies,
complete with Melee and Magic combat,each of two varieties (Str/Dex, Int/Fth), 
but I was unable to implement many things. 
(I didn't mention some of these in the project proposal, 
as I was unsure of if I'd be able to figure them out in time).

Plans for future development would include all of those.  
I made a text-based RPG last year (not for any of my classes),
and this would be a version of that with controller support, 
more interactive gameplay (as opposed to the turn-based gameplay I 
implemented in the text-based version), and video/audio.

I do intend to complete this project on my own time, when I'm able,
as this is something I've wanted to do since high school, which means,
now, I'll have to do more research on my own, which is ok.

Unrelatedly to important future dev, I intend on spending a *lot* of time
on the magic system, as I am unsatisfied with the current state of magic in
video games, and wish to create something that I will enjoy to play
with my brother.  This also means I'll have to polish the melee combat
very well, as he prefers big tanky gameplay with big bonks.  
This is for the best anyways.
